# Salifort-Motors-project
Capstone Project of Google Advanced Data Analytics.

For this project, the goal is help an HR team improve employees' satisfaction level within the company. To do so, EDA was conducted to
understand the data provided - creating visuals to analyze relationships between variables. A logistic regression model was build to predict whether an employee leaves the company based on the variables of interest.
