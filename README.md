# Salifort-Motors-project
Capstone Project of Google Advanced Data Analytics.

For this project, the goal is help an HR team improve employees' satisfaction level within the company. To do so, EDA was conducted to
understand the data provided - creating visuals to analyze relationships between variables. A logistic regression model was built to predict whether an employee leaves the company based on the variables of interest. 

Throughout the analysis, factors that led to employees leaving/having unsatisfaction level are overworking, working on too many projects, and not receiving promotion. To improve satisfaction level, the companny should consider updating the work policy so that workers are either not working overtime or being compensated for longer work hours than average. The company should also restrict the amount of projects employees can work on. Promoting more employees would improve the employees' satisfaction as well.
